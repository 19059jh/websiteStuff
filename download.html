  <p id="text"> Read this first: This zip contains the files needed to at least run this game, though upon booting the game up, windows defender will recognize that there is no certificate, and an alert will pop up on screen. To bypass this perss more info and press run anyway. <br>
There is no way to close the game once launched, however. The workaround I found to be effect is to alt-tab and then press the X button on the window.<br>
 
  The controls use the arrow keys to tilt the plane up & down.
